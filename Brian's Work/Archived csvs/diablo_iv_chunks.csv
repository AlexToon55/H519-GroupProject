The Tower and Leaderboards
General
Tower now unlocks Tiers the same way the Pit does. Encounters
Monster populations have been tuned to be fair to both ranged and melee builds. Bosses have been adjusted to remove unwanted behavior such as self healing and invisibility. Boss health has been lowered to have parity with Pit Bosses. Pylons
Removed the delay between when a Pylon Cage is destroyed and when a Pylon can be used. Pylon health has been reduced in an effort to make them less tanky. Tuned the pylons to be more balanced to avoid unfair rolls of pylon spawn order. Pylon of Power
Damage from 4[x] to 3[x]. Pylon of Speed
Player gains a chunk of Temporary Attack Speed (+50% Attack Speed). Player can Knockdown enemies they pass through. Pylon of Channeling, Shrine of Channeling
Resource gain per second to support builds that drain resource which don't benefit from Cost Reduction. Orbs
Orbs drop immediately when the monster dies, and no longer wait for post-Death effects (Elite affixes like Fire enchanted, certain spiders, etc.)
If the orb drops close enough to the player, orbs will appear closer to you to avoid backtracking. If you are too far, orbs will drop at the corpse of the enemy that dropped it. Quality of Life
Dying will never respawn players on the previous floor. Exit portals now spawn closer to the player at the end of a run. Game Updates
Spinning hazards in certain areas in the Vault of the Crucible dungeon have been removed. Locked Capstone Dungeons will now show on the map and display a tooltip which describes requirements to unlock. Various updates to The Tower. Developer’s Note:

Each enemy hit by Teleport increases the damage by 5-15%|x| and reduces the Cooldown by 0.5 seconds of the next cast. Casting Teleport grants a stack of Galvanization, increasing its damage by 30-50% for 8 seconds. Becoming Injured Teleports you to a random location. Developer’s Note:
This option has been treated as mandatory for too long. We're reducing the frequency of its procs and cutting away some of its synergies to allow the Teleport Skill to be your premiere source of mobility and utility. Fractured Winterglass

Elites
Dungeon and Overworld content have had their Elite densities adjusted to compensate for the new rarities of Champion and Rare. The Undercity Afflicted Monsters now use the new rarity system, resulting in fewer places to get additional time, presenting more of a challenge. For more details on Monster changes, please see the section above. Economy Updates
Developer’s Note:
With the changes to Renown, the pace of the early leveling journey is a fair bit slower. With the longer time to level, players were spending long periods of time where only one rarity of item was dropping. To combat this, we adjusted the level-over-level shift in item frequency to be more gradual for Normal, Legendary, and Rare Items. Item Rarity
Normal Items will continue dropping for longer while leveling. Magic Items will more frequently have a bonus affix. Rare Items will be rarer before Level 30. Legendary Items will be rarer before Level 40, and rapidly increase in frequency after. The legendary rate for a Level 40 character in season 11 will be equivalent to the legendary rate for a level 25 character in season 10. The legendary rate is unchanged for a Level 60 character. Legendary Items have an additional Affix for a total of 4.",398
28,2.5.0,69713,"December 11, 2025","Monster Loot
Killing the last Champion in a pack, or any Elite, will always drop equipment and gold, in addition to their standard reward chances. In addition to dropping Gem Fragments, Monsters have a chance of dropping a level-appropriate Gem. Altars of Lilith
Altars of Lilith no longer grant permanent character rewards, such as stat increases or Paragon points. Instead, discovering a statue for the first time will award a small amount of gem fragments, obols, and gold. Crafters

Masterworking has been redesigned. Items have a new stat, Refinement, which is displayed on the item tooltip. Each time the player Masterworks an item, the refinement value of the item is increased by a random tunable amount (1-3%), up to a Max Refinement Threshold (20%). Once at the cap, the item is considered Masterworked. The base properties of an item are scaled by Refinement at a 1:1 bonus. Example:
A Chest item with 100 armor
Refinement 0% = 100 Armor
Refinement 5% = 105 Armor
Refinement 20% = 120 Armor
A Masterworked item can be refined one more time to upgrade an affix to a Greater Affix. Players may re-roll the Masterworked Greater Affix by spending Neathiron, a returning resource to once again discover in Sanctuary. The quantity of Obducite you earn has been adjusted. Players will earn 85% less Obducite, and recipes requiring Obducite have been similarly reduced. Items no longer need to have been tempered to be Masterworked. Vendors
