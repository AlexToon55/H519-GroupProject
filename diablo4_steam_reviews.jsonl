The story campaign is one of the best in the series, and character building feels rewarding, especially in the early game.\r\n\r\nHowever, the longer you play, the more issues appear: repetitive endgame grind, seasonal balance decisions, and aggressive monetization (battle pass, cash shop) that doesn’t sit well in a full-price game. Always-online requirement can also be annoying.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n\r\nDark atmosphere and top-tier visuals\r\n\r\nVery good story campaign\r\n\r\nSmooth and impactful combat\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n\r\nRepetitive endgame\r\n\r\nHeavy monetization\r\n\r\nAlways-online requirement\r\n\r\nFinal thoughts:\r\nA great experience at the beginning and a solid entry for Diablo fans, but it may lose its charm over time. Best enjoyed on sale.\r\n\r\n\r\n🇵🇱 Recenzja – Diablo IV (PL)\r\n\r\n👍 Polecam, ale z zastrzeżeniami\r\n\r\nDiablo IV to bardzo solidne ARPG z mrocznym klimatem, świetną grafiką i satysfakcjonującą walką. Kampania fabularna jest jedną z najlepszych w całej serii, a budowanie postaci daje sporo frajdy, zwłaszcza na początku.\r\n\r\nNiestety, im dalej w endgame, tym bardziej widać problemy: powtarzalny grind, decyzje balansowe pod sezony oraz mocno odczuwalna monetyzacja (battle pass, sklep), która średnio pasuje do gry w pełnej cenie. Do tego zawsze-online potrafi zirytować.\r\n\r\nPlusy:\r\n\r\nKlimat i oprawa audiowizualna\r\n\r\nBardzo dobra kampania fabularna\r\n\r\nPrzyjemny, dynamiczny system walki\r\n\r\nMinusy:\r\n\r\nPowtarzalny endgame\r\n\r\nKontrowersyjna monetyzacja\r\n\r\nWymagane stałe połączenie z internetem\r\n\r\nPodsumowanie:\r\nŚwietna gra na start i dla fanów serii, ale długoterminowo potrafi zmęczyć. Warto, szczególnie na promocji."}

Also i am a bigger fan of the Itemisation and the Endgame in General. The current season and the Paladin are big step ups.\n\nWhy not from the start Blizzard? Ahh yes we know why. Higher Ups.\n\nD4 is rn quite fun. I enjoy playing it currently.\n\nDespite some very weird bugs, like the one where you cannot open Azmodans Hoard because of some Timezone fuckery..?

The combat? Chef’s kiss. Every swing, every spell, every corpse explosion hits like a freight train made of pure dopamine. Barbarian spinning to win, Sorceress turning the screen into a fireworks show, Rogue darting around like he’s too fast for the laws of physics—doesn’t matter. You feel unstoppable. The world is dark, gorgeous, and dripping with that classic Diablo vibe. Lilith shows up looking like she could step on you and you’d thank her. 10/10 atmosphere, no notes.\n\nSeasons keep dropping new toys, new builds, new ways to delete hordes of demons in increasingly unhinged ways. Infernal Hordes? More like Infernal Copium for the weak. You’re out here farming waves like it’s your job and you’re employee of the month every month.\n\nNow, the endgame. Ah yes. The Pit. Torment 4. Trying to push past Paragon 200 toward that glorious 300. The game looks you dead in the eye, flexes, and says “Prove you belong here, bro.”\n\nYou need 12/12 Greater Affixes. You need triple mythic uniques that don’t drop. You need masterworking to hit 12 without bricking your item for the 47th time. One misplaced roll and it’s back to Nightmare Dungeon #682. The RNG is not random—it’s personal. It hates you specifically. You will sacrifice 47 altars of Lilith and still get boots with +movement speed instead of the one stat you need.\n\nBut here’s the thing: **real Chads don’t complain about the grind.** Weaklings quit at Pit 80 and cry on Reddit. True 500+ hour gigachads stare into the abyss of endless material farming, laugh, and whisper “thank you sir may I have another.” The pain is the point. Every failed temper, every bricked item, every 0.0001% drop that ghosts you—it’s building character. You emerge from the Pit battered, broken, and somehow stronger, like you just did 1000 push-ups while Lilith roasted your life choices.\n\nDiablo 4 doesn’t respect your time. It respects your **will.**\n\nSo yes, it’s brutal. Yes, getting to Paragon 300 is basically self-inflicted war crime. But when you finally delete a screen of demons in 0.3 seconds with your perfectly rolled build? When you clear Pit 150 and the game finally bows?\n\n**Chef’s kiss.** Absolute cinema. 9.5/10.\n\nWould sacrifice another 500 hours again. No hesitation. Stay hard, Sanctuary."}

Other times, it just makes you want to slap Blizzard across the face.\n\n\n📜 The beginning of my experience:\nI played at a slow pace, with no rush to reach the endgame, and the first thing that stood out was the weight of the world. Not in an overdone “dark fantasy” way, but in a sense of exhaustion.\n\nSanctuary feels like a place where nothing worked out, where people no longer expect salvation. And that works. The story doesn’t try to impress you every second. It walks alongside you.\n\nLilith, in particular, isn’t a villain who screams evil. She questions, provokes, and sometimes makes way too much sense. More than once, I found myself more uncomfortable with the so-called “heroes” than with her.\n\n\n🍺 My overall take:\nDiablo 4 today is a functional, solid game that finally aligns with what it promised, but it still carries questionable Blizzard decisions that feel like they were made by a committee, not by people who actually play.\n\nIt delivers good combat, a heavy atmosphere, and addictive progression, as long as you accept that part of your time will be spent running recycled content in exchange for loot that’s almost good.\n\nThe expansion improves pacing, adds real build options, and the Paladin comes in as a well-designed class, not a band-aid fix. Even so, the game suffers from the same old issue. Once the new content runs out, it becomes clear the endgame still needs more purpose than just “making numbers go up for no real reason.”\n\nIf you like the style, you’ll have fun. If you’re expecting something revolutionary, you’ll eventually realize this is controlled evolution, not bold ambition."}

The scenery and monster design is gorgeous: I frequently catch myself just stopping for a bit to look at everything (I seriously want a map maker so that I can make visual handouts for my D&D campaign). The game play is fast and crazy, but it's easy to change your playstyle instantly via respeccing. Like any other game of this genre, it gets repetitive, but the promise of new cosmetic items is always pulling me back it, which is quite silly in retrospect but whatever, I've been having fun so far. A bit pricey, but no regrets yet. I like that the only in-game store items are just cosmetics; no \"pay to win\" structure here at all. Fun for casuals, I can't comment on the viability of \"serious\" play."}
