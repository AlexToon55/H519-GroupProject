Instead of randomly gaining an affix from the desired Temper Manual, any learned temper affix can be selected specifically and rolled onto the item.\nThe number of Temper rolls available on an item has changed.\nRare\nPrevious: 5 Tempers\nNow: 1 Temper\nLegendary and beyond\nPrevious: 5 Tempers, plus one per Greater Affix.\nNow: 3 Tempers, plus one per Greater Affix.\nScrolls of Restoration have been redesigned.\nScrolls of Restoration no longer restore all temper charges to an item.
